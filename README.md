This is an ongoing project to construct a toy model of the Biomedical Datahub's **DAR** **t**ech **s**tack (hence, DARts) using docker containers to represent instances/machines.

It's not supposed to be accurate, consider it a fanfic constructed using publicly available and publicly searchable information from https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii/research/datahub-division/biomed-dar and https://www.a-star.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider41/bii-pi-seminar-day-2021/part-ii/wingcheong_biomeddar.pdf?sfvrsn=8203bfc_2 as well as the codebase from https://github.com/bii-absd/tims
